## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 OpenBMC Hardware Simulation & Redfish API Integration

🛠 Tech: OpenBMC, Yocto, QEMU, DBus, Redfish, curl/jq, systemd

💪 Accomplishments:
- Simulated hardware sensor data (power, temperature, voltage) using **OpenBMC QEMU** and exposed it via **Redfish REST API** for a custom dashboard.
- Extracted and parsed sensor values using **curl**, verified with real-time system via **systemctl** commands.
- Bridged the gap between simulated sensors in QEMU and Redfish REST output, showing the values of the system. 
- Automated and viewed testing and monitoring commands to validate health, temperature, and voltage fields. 
- Laid groundwork for integrating dashboard metrics into a **GUI** or backend framework

### 🔹 LLVM McToll — Binary Translator Debugging

🛠 Tech: C++, LLVM IR, assembly-level debugging, Clang, lit testing
 
💪 Accomplishments:
- Achieved working proficiency in Linux for software development and debugging purposes. Understood the architecture and goals of the LLVM-Mctoll project and actively contributed to it.
- Changed the architecture and refactored the system from **x86 to Arch64**.
- Completed and validated a **test case** for the **AND instruction**, representing a functional step in the dynamic translation workflow.  
- Improved overall system performance through debugging, optimization, and memory management.
- Debugged compiler errors and enhanced multi-architecture test systems.

### 🔹 Chess Application — ARM to ARM64 Migration & Backend Integration

🛠 Tech: Android Studio, Java/Kotlin, NDK, Gradle, ARM64 optimization

💪 Accomplishments:
- Migrated Android chess app from ARM to ARM64 for better performance and compliance with **Google Play’s 64-bit requirement**.
- Refactoring native C/C++ code components and ensuring they compiled correctly for Arch64 using the **Android NDK**.  
- Updating the Gradle build configuration and **ABI filters** to support **arm64-v8a**, with primary optimization for the latter.  
- Resolving cross-compilation issues during the migration, particularly in areas where **32-bit** assumptions (like pointer sizes and memory alignment) were hardcoded.  
- Testing the app for crashes and validating the **Arch64** build on physical and emulated devices to ensure compatibility, stability, and improved performance.
